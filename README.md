Learning Java part 2 - Arrays, Characters

This was coded as part of a TUM introduction in programming course.
The program is a UTF8-coded java file. The MiniJava file was provided by the chair of Algorithms and Complexity of TU Munich.

Instruction:

Write a program which implements the following features. The user should be able to enter any text. 
Use the library function of the string class except for char charAt(int i) and int length().
Implement the following features:
1. Frequency of letters: 
The program should output the frequency for any letter that appears in the text in alphabetical order while excluding those that don't appear. It should not differentiate between upper and lower case and characters other than letters should be ignored. 
2. Replace letters
The user should be able to enter two letters and the program should then replace the first entered letter with the second. The use of capital and small letters should be maintained. 
3. Mirror words
Your program should output any word of an entered text backwards. Punctuation characters are part of words. Example: 
Input: “Da dank ich Euch; denn mit den Toten.“
Output: “aD knad hci ;hcuE nned tim ned .netoT“
